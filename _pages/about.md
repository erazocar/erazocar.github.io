Interested in the development of web based hydroinformatic tools for research and education. Particular focus on data analytics, machine learning, web development,  computational optimization, and state of the art mathematical frameworks for hydrological modelling. I am now trying to learn about 3D rendering, peer to peer data communication and heavy computation through minimal vanilla-as-possible approach.

I continously get involved with social equity projects and hope to add my grain of salt towards the betterment of my homecountry Honduras. I plan on doing this by using state of the art technology to promote research, education, and decision making in locations worldwide with lack of proper infrastructures and data services.

I love travelling, running, eating exotic food, and basically learning new things. I enjoy reading mostly classic authors (favorite book: Notes from the Undeground, Dost.), and have the idea of someday writing something of my own. Haven't started yet.
