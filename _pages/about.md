I'm interested in creating web-based hydroinformatic tools for research and education. A special emphasis on data analytics, machine learning, web development, computational optimization, and cutting-edge mathematical frameworks for hydrological modeling. I'm now attempting to learn about 3D rendering, peer-to-peer data sharing, and intensive computation using native technologies.

I am interested in social equality projects and wish to contribute my grain of salt to the welfare of my homecountry, Honduras. I intend to accomplish this by creating applications employing cutting-edge technology to support research, education, and decision making.

I enjoy traveling, exercising and like mostly all sports, trying new foods, and learning new things. I like to read classic authors (favorite book: Notes from the Underground, Dost.) and hope to write something of my own one day. Not anytime soon.

Any questions about my research or anything in general, send me an email and will gladly get back.
