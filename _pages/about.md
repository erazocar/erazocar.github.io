I'm interested in creating web-based hydroinformatic tools for research and education. A special emphasis is placed on data analytics, machine learning, web development, computational optimization, and cutting-edge mathematical frameworks for hydrological modeling. I'm now attempting to learn about 3D rendering, peer-to-peer data sharing, and intensive computation using native technologies.

I am constantly interested in social equality projects and wish to contribute my grain of salt to the welfare of my native country, Honduras. I intend to accomplish this by employing cutting-edge technology to support research, education, and decision making in areas throughout the world where basic infrastructure and data services are lacking.

I enjoy traveling, running, trying new foods, and generally learning new things. I mostly read classic authors (favorite book: Notes from the Underground, Dost.) and hope to write something of my own one day. I have not yet begun.
